description: Launch supported coding agents in Supaterm tabs or panes and deliver multiline prompts safely. Use when starting Codex or another supported coding agent in Supaterm, choosing between a tab and split pane, sending a follow-up prompt, or verifying an agent launch.

# Coding agents

Use a new tab for an independent task and a split pane for work beside an existing terminal. Keep repository setup and task policy outside the launch command.

## Initial prompt

Read a multiline prompt from a file into one argument, then pass that argument to the agent executable. Supaterm launches the agent directly, resolves it with the caller's `PATH`, preserves every argument exactly, and skips shell startup files. The initial prompt travels through process arguments instead of terminal input.

```bash
prompt_file=/tmp/task-prompt.md
workspace="$PWD"
prompt="$(cat "$prompt_file")"

pane_id="$(
  sp tab new \
    --plain \
    --cwd "$workspace" \
    -- codex -- "$prompt"
)"
sp pane wait-ready "$pane_id" --timeout 10 --quiet
printf 'paneID=%s\n' "$pane_id"
```

The first `--` ends `sp` options. The second ends Codex options so prompt text such as `resume`, `review`, or a leading dash remains a prompt. Use the equivalent end-of-options form with another supported `<agent>` executable. New tabs and panes leave focus unchanged by default. Use `--focus` when the new terminal should become active.

When the agent exits, the tab or pane closes.

## Split pane

Target a tab or pane with `--in` and retain the returned pane UUID for follow-up commands:

```bash
prompt_file=/tmp/task-prompt.md
workspace="$PWD"
prompt="$(cat "$prompt_file")"
agent_executable="<agent>"
target="t:6bfc889d"

pane_id="$(
  sp pane split right \
    --plain \
    --in "$target" \
    --cwd "$workspace" \
    -- "$agent_executable" -- "$prompt"
)"
sp pane wait-ready "$pane_id" --timeout 10 --quiet
printf 'paneID=%s\n' "$pane_id"
```

Run each block in one shell invocation. Shell variables do not survive separate agent tool calls. For a later call, paste the printed pane UUID as a literal target. If you use `--instance` or `--socket`, repeat it on every `sp` call; the CLI retains no connection state.

Agent-panel forks use a different launch mode. Supaterm starts the account login shell and enters the agent's native fork command visibly. Codex forks keep supported launch options from the source process, such as `--profile`. The pane returns to that same shell when the forked agent exits.

## Follow-up prompt

Submit follow-up text through paste-aware transport:

```bash
prompt_file=/tmp/task-prompt.md
sp pane send --submit <pane-uuid> - < "$prompt_file"
```

`--submit` pastes the complete prompt, preserves embedded newlines, then presses Enter separately. This avoids interactive paste-burst handling that can turn Enter into another newline.

Do not use `--newline`, typed bracketed-paste escape sequences, or timing sleeps to submit a prompt.

## Interrupt

Send Ctrl-C to a coding agent through the native key route:

```bash
sp pane key ctrl-c <pane-uuid>
```

## Verify

Capture the agent pane after launch or submission:

```bash
sp pane capture --scope scrollback --lines 160 <pane-uuid>
```

Use the UUID printed by `sp tab new --plain` or `sp pane split --plain`; do not rediscover the pane by title.
